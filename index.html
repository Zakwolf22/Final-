        <p class="dek">2020 was won of the most polarizing elections in the history of the United States, yet less tha half of the population didn't vote Here's a look at voter registration data in each state throughout the U.S from this past election.</p>

        <p>In the 2020 Presidential Election over 150 million American citizens casted a ballot voting for the candidate of their choice. That’s less than 50% of the American population. Despite the fact less than half of Americans voted, 100 million more people were registered to vote.</p>

        <p>During the 2020 election the average amount of the percentage of citizens registered to vote was just under 69%. The percentages varied from state-to-state and since some have stricter registration laws and more obstacles to register. Meanwhile other states have started to adopt easier methods of voting instead of everyone voting on election day. Arkansas, which has more restrictive laws, had the lowest rate of any state (59%) — one of 12 states with less than 65% of its population registered. </p>

        <p>"Dustin Czarny, the Onondaga County Elections commissioner said the most prevalent laws which limit voter registration can have a “chilling effect”. In certain state’s you’re required to have a driver's license and valid form of identification. Czarny explained Texas has a law where students can’t show their student I.D to register to vote, which hurts the younger population. Yet if you have a gun license and display that when registering, it’s allowed. In 2020, just 62% of Texas’s population was registered to vote, the seventh lowest total in the country.</p>

        <p>Another state which has restrictive laws is Florida. Czarny explained registration drives have been “almost outlawed” with how strict their rules are. In Florida your organization needs to be cleared to be able to run a registration drive. Czarny explained it’s had a “large effect” on minority neighborhoods and student populations. In turn, just 61% percent of Florida citizens were registered to vote in 2020.</p>

        <p>“If you have a more onerous way to apply to be registered to vote, you're going to have lower registration rates compared to your eligible population.”</p>

        <p>One state with less restrictive laws is Minnesota, who had the highest portion of its population registered to vote in 2020. Nearly 80% of its citizens were registered due to its moe relaxed laws around voting. Czarny emphasized methods like mail-in voting, same-day registration and early voting.</p>

        <p>With the COVID-19 pandemic and fear of getting sick, some states implemented these rules to keep turnout high. Although Czarny explained states like Oregon had been doing a good job of introducing new methods of voting prior to the Pandemic. In 2020, Oregon had 77% of its population registered, the third highest rate in the U.S.</p>

        <p>“The states that have all or some of those tools are going to have higher registration rates than states that don't and there's a lot of states that have none of that,” Czarny said.</p>

        <p>Czarny also pointed towards California and New York, although just 59% of Californians are registered to vote along with 62% of New Yorkers. Since both states usually vote for democrats and are two of the most populous states in the U.S, some citizens might not feel the need to vote since they might not see a point.</p>

        <p>2020 was a presidential election year, meaning turnout could’ve been slightly driven up by that fact. Czarny pointed out the excitement former President Barack Obama created in 2008 and how that drove up turnout. But  Czarny explained over the past few election cycles negative partisanship has driven turnout. In 2020, there was a lot of anti-Donald Trump voters and not necessarily Joe Biden voters.</p>

<p>“Turnout is not necessarily dependent on positive feelings of your candidate as much as negative feelings of the consequences of not voting for your party or voting for your ideology,” Czarny said. </p>

<p> In terms of the future, if different states implement more relaxed voter registration laws it can lead to a higher rate of citizens doing their civic duty. Some states have started the trend while others remain steadfast in making it harder to vote in elections.</p>


<p>“Voting should be as easy as possible,” Czarny said. Making the choices is hard, but the actual mechanism of recording your choice shouldn't be that hard.”</p>
